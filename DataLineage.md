## Product: Data Lineage
	
	Data Lineage refers to the "life story" of your data. 


How I Can Help You
As your AI partner, I can assist with several aspects of data lineage:

SQL Parsing: Paste a complex SQL query, and I can map out the dependencies and transformations for you.

Tool Comparison: I can help you evaluate lineage tools like dbt, Collibra, Alation, or OpenLineage based on your tech stack.

Strategy: I can help you design a metadata strategy to ensure lineage is captured automatically rather than manually documented.
